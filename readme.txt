== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The facet has not the locale attributes! =

Probably you have been created the indices before activate the plugin.
You need to delete the indices and re-index it.

Or, you can manually add the facet in the Algolia dashboard.

= How can we search by the locale attribute? =

You can search by the following query.

`index.search("", {
 "getRankingInfo": true,
 "analytics": false,
 "enableABTest": false,
 "hitsPerPage": 10,
 "attributesToRetrieve": "*",
 "attributesToSnippet": "*:20",
 "snippetEllipsisText": "â€¦",
 "responseFields": "*",
 "maxValuesPerFacet": 100,
 "page": 0,
 "facets": [
  "*",
  "locale",
 ],
 "facetFilters": [
  [
   "locale:en_US"
  ]
 ]
});`

= When the Bogo plugin deactivated, what the behavior will changes? =

Bogo will put the `_locale` attributes into the post_meta, and the plugin uses it.
So the plugin still put the locale attributes if exists.

But, if the post has no `_locale` post_meta attribute, the plugin does not put the locale attributes.
